## Guide to setting up Github!

*This is adapted from [Katy Abbott's guide](https://github.com/amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-Oceans-Six/blob/master/git-instructions.md)*

- [x] 1. Log into GitHub on your browser, and navigate to [https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_ClimateCoders](https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_ClimateCoders). This is the repository where we will store all of our code this year.

- [x] 2. Navigate to the right side of the window and click on &quot;Fork&quot;. This will save a new copy of the repository to your own GitHub account.

- [x] 3. Open up Terminal. Decide where you want to store your GitHub repository on your computer, and navigate there. 

Useful terminal commands:
   * **cd path/folder_name** navigates to a folder
   * **ls** shows all the files in your folder/directory.
   * **cd ..** moves you up one folder
   * **cd** (without any names after it) takes you to your home directory

 - [x] 4. Once you're in the right location, clone your repository. This adds a local copy to your own computer, and you can make changes there! In Terminal, type **git clone \<url\>**, where **\<url\>** is the URL of your forked repository.
    * To find this URL, go to your GitHub account, open the repositories tab, find the forked repository, and click on the green button on the right side that says, \"Clone or download.\" Copy the URL it gives you.

  Make sure you're cloning your _forked_ repository, not the original! You can tell because in the top left corner, where it says the name of the repository, it will also have a description that identifies where it was forked from. This is an example of me forking to a previous Helen Fellow's GitHub.
