## Guide to setting up Github!

*This is adapted from Katy Abbott's guide*

1. Log into GitHub on your browser, and navigate to [https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_groupname](https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_groupname). This is the repository where we will store all of our code this year.

2. Navigate to the right side of the window and click on &quot;Fork&quot;. This will save a new copy of the repository to your own GitHub account.

3. Open up Terminal. Decide where you want to store your GitHub repository on your computer, and navigate there. 
    * To change folders, type **cd path/folder_name**
    * Other tips:
      * **ls** shows all the files in your folder/directory.
      * **cd ..** moves you up one folder
      * **cd** (without any names after it) takes you to your home directory
