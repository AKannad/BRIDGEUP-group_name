## Guide to setting up Github!

*This is adapted from Katy Abbott's guide*

- [x] Log into GitHub on your browser, and navigate to [https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_groupname](https://github.com/AKannad/BRIDGEUP_ClimateCoders). This is the repository where we will store all of our code this year.

- [x] Navigate to the right side of the window and click on &quot;Fork&quot;. This will save a new copy of the repository to your own GitHub account.

- [x] Open up Terminal. Decide where you want to store your GitHub repository on your computer, and navigate there. Useful terminal commands:
   * **cd path/folder_name** navigates to a folder
   * **ls** shows all the files in your folder/directory.
   * **cd ..** moves you up one folder
   * **cd** (without any names after it) takes you to your home directory
